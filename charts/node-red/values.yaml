  ## node-red data Persistent Volume Storage Class
  ## If defined, storageClassName: <storageClass>
  ## If set to "-", storageClassName: "", which disables dynamic provisioning
  ## If undefined (the default) or set to null, no storageClassName spec is
  ##   set, choosing the default provisioner.  (gp2 on AWS, standard on
  ##   GKE, AWS & OpenStack)

    - ReadWriteOnce

  ## If subPath is set mount a sub folder of a volume instead of the root of the volume.
  ## This is especially handy for volume plugins that don't natively support sub mounting (like glusterfs).
